    "This is too funny - when we were on the phone that one time, I had the idea that next time you tell me that you love me I'll surprise you by responding in Icelandic. The flaw in my plan was that I had no clue how to pronouce <i>ég elska þig líka</i> and I couldn't play any audio of how it's supposed to sound because you'd hear it. So I was Googling everything I could to try and figure it out, silently. Then you suddenly said 'I love you', and so I took my best shot at it.
